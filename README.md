# FlaskApp
Flask web app that will read from a database containing spells from dungeons and dragons.
The web app has a search bar and some conditions. These include search types such as search for spells by id, name, etc... and min and max levels.
It displays the results from the queries in a table with toggleable columns which can be toggled using the collaspable div that contains checkboxes.
